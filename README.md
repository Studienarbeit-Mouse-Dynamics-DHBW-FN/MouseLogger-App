# Mouselogger
This `kivy` application logs the mouse dynamics of the user (movement, clicks, scrolling).

Using `kivyMD` and `pynput` the app collects the data and uploads it to our server.
We are a small dev team using data for our student research paper.

Feel free to fork our repo or use the released application to help us in our research.


## Requirements
The `python` requirements can be found in the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Studienarbeit-Mouse-Dynamics-DHBW-FN/MouseLogger-App/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## Build app
To build the app under windows, just run:

`pyinstaller main.spec`
